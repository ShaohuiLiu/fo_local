# Data-driven Forced Oscillation Localization
We propose a comprehensive data-driven framework for inferring the sources of forced oscillation (FO) using only synchrophasor measurements. During normal grid operations, fast-rate ambient data are collected to recover the impulse responses in the small-signal regime, without requiring the system models.

Datasets generated by PST in Matlab using the 68-bus system with 16 generators. \
